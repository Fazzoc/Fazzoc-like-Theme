## **Installation**

### **1) 🛑 Install Fazzoc-Like Lightly Theme Style**
* To match the screenshots below, you must **INSTALL** *Lightly*, which will provide your Plasma desktop the correct Window Decorations and Application Style. To do that, simply follow the installation instructions [on the unofficial Lightly repository](https://github.com/Luwx/Lightly).

* Once Lightly installed, remember to go to:
`System Settings` --> `Appearance` --> `Application Style` and `Window Decorations` in order to apply it to your system.

* You can install *Aritim-Dark* before or after *Lightly*, just remember to apply both once installed :D

### **2) 🎯 Install Aritim-Dark - Fazzoc-like Plasma Style**

* Aritim-Dark can be installed in one click from the `Settings` page provided by each KDE-based Linux distribution.

* Open `System Settings` --> `Appearance` --> `Plasma Style` section --> "`Install from file...`" button. This will automatically install all the theme components (color scheme, plasma style etc...) you can find in this repository.

### **2) 🎉 Enjoy!**
* **Now it's up to you!**
* I tend to leave the theme as generic as possible to please everyone's likings (and believe me it's not easy 😆), so some visual adjustments may be needed just after installation.
* Move panels here and there, change wallpapers as you like, the imagination is the only limit!

### **1) 🔎 Repo Organization**

* You can find everything related to Aritim-Dark in this repository, which is organized in subfolders.

* Please, refer to the badges "`development`" you can find in each `README`, below you can find some additional infos.

  1. [![DevelopmentStatus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Ongoing-brightgreen.svg)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Ongoing-brightgreen.svg)
     > This means I'm currently enhancing/fixing the project. I'm open to suggestions and Pull Requests, that will be treated as soon as possible.
  2. [![DevelopmentStatus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Paused-yellow.svg)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Paused-yellow.svg)
     > This means I'm currently not considering the project as a top priority, hence issues and Pull Request will be still treated, but with higher delays. The development status can reach a higher priority ("Ongoing") or a lower one "Stopped" at any time.
  3. [![DevelopmentStatus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Stopped-red.svg)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Stopped-red.svg)
     > This means I'd prefer to consider this project abandoned. I could reconsider this development status only if some really big opportunities present themselves and really worth the effort. Issues and PR will be probably read but not considered.

### **5) 📎 LICENSES**
For every subfolder you'll find a specific license: many of my projects rely on other's people previous work, each of them with their proper license.
I always try to be as correct and thankful as possible: if you see some inconsistencies on licenses please be free to open an issue/PR for this repo and explain the problem. I will reply ASAP and fix the issue. The last thing I want to do is to harm someone else's IP. 

Of course, I'm expecting the same treatment in case you'll decide to publish modifications of my projects.
